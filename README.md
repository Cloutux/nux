# **NUX**
### **NUX**, also known as **NuxLD** (NUX Layered Desktop) acts as a desktop environment, with extended functionality;
It is meant to be a way for the user to more directly control the Linux desktop, aiming to enchance the overall user experience.

---
### How it works:
The desktop is broken down into "layers", which are all fully customizable, with their respective config files. These layers all perform different tasks and have separate functions:
from controlling the way the desktop layout is generated, to the method used to render the graphical interface.

### More about layers:
As mentioned before, **layers** do different things, in order:

**Main tasks:**
+ `mgr_layout`; Layout manager - layout generator; layout consists of: 
1. Menus like the Topbar, Sidebar, etc.  
1. The actual desktop, where shortcuts reside
1. Applications, which are visible as tiles or windows
+ `mgr_`;
+ `mgr_scene-out`; Render manager - render the user interface. By default, this is applicable via these methods:
